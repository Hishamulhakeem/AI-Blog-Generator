It is one of the most popular sports in the world, especially in countries like India, Australia, England, Pakistan, and South Africa. The game is played on a circular or oval-shaped field, with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch at the center.\n",

      "1. **Objective**: The main objective is to score more runs than the opposing team.\n",

      "### Key Terms:\n",
      "- **Bowler**: The player who delivers the ball to the batsman.\n",

      "- **Umpire**: The official who enforces the rules of the game.\n",
      "- **Fielding**: The act of defending against the batting team and trying to prevent runs from being scored.\n",

      "- **ICC Cricket World Cup**: The premier international championship of One Day International cricket.\n",
      "- **ICC T20 World Cup**: The international championship for T20 cricket.\n",
      "- **The Ashes**: A Test cricket series played between England and Australia.\n",
